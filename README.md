A clean reddit UI!

To start, fork and clone this repo.

From the main directory, type ```npm install``` in your command prompt.

Next, compile the JSX with the command ```npm run webpack``` from the same directory.

Note, no server is provided, so use something like NPM Serve to serve the client-side files. CD into the "src" directory, and run ```serve client``` from there.

Finally, visit ```http://localhost:3000``` and you should be up and running!
